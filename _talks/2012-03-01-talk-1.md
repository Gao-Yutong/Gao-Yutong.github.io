  * Collected data on plant diversity and environmental factors from 134 sampling points distributed along two 18km-wide transects (east-west and north-south) that passed through the city center. The phylogenetic diversity of plants at each sampling site was then calculated. Subsequently, gradient analysis was employed to explore the distribution patterns of plant phylogenetic diversity along the urban-rural gradients.

 
  * Analyzed the relationship between plant phylogenetic diversity and the degree of urbanization. The proportion of urban land use within a 1km radius around each sampling point was used as an indicator of urbanization. Regression analysis was then conducted to investigate this relationship.

 
  * Investigated the impact and pathways of urbanization on plant phylogenetic diversity. Based on four urban filters namely, habitat transformation, habitat fragmentation, urban environmental factors, and human preferences. Redundancy analysis and structural equation model was used to examine the relationships and relative importance of multiple factors on plant system development diversity.
