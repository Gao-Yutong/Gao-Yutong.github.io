**Abstract**

Recently, the establishment of urban forest parks has become one of the main ways of urban renewal and ecosystem remediation in Beijing. A case study over the Guangyanggu Urban Forest Park and Baiwangshan Forest Park has been carried out by our team, so as to collect and analyze visitors' environmental perception and usage activity characteristics, the method of Post Occupancy Evaluation and behaviors observation survey has been applied in this research. The result provides a profound understanding of the difference of visitors' perception and behavior characteristics for two forest parks. Base on the result, we propose that landscape design should be focus on plants, hence to protect forest resources. Meanwhile, we suggest that space design should be refined to balance ecological and social functions. Finally, in the small urban forest parks of high - density cities, the relevant service facilities should be increased for the elders.
