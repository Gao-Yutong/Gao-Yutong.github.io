excerpt: 'Abstract

Context: The spatial distribution of plant diversity in urban areas is fundamental to understanding the relationship between urbanization and biodiversity. Previous research has primarily focused on taxonomic levels to assess species richness. While investigations into the spatial patterns of phylogenetic diversity in urban plants remain limited.

Objectives: This study aims to investigate the spatial patterns of plant phylogenetic diversity along an urban-rural gradient and identify how phylogenetic diversity and the degree of urbanization are related.
Methods: A survey of vascular plants was conducted at 134 randomly selected sample plots along four urban-rural transects in Shanghai, China. Three phylogenetic diversity metrics, Faith’s phylogenetic diversity (PD), net relatedness index (NRI), and net nearest taxon index (NTI), were calculated along with the urbanization degree index (UDI). Regression analysis was employed to quantify the spatial patterns of plant phylogenetic diversity across different taxa along the urban-rural gradients and their relationships with UDI. 

Results: The study observed six distinct patterns of plant phylogenetic diversity along the urban-rural gradients in different taxa, which support the previous hypotheses that biological distribution patterns at the species level also hold true at the phylogenetic level. Faith’s phylogenetic diversity (PD) showed a linear increase with increasing UDI for total, woody, perennial, and cultivated plant assemblages. The UDI explained 66-96% of the variation in PD for these taxa. In contrast, PD for annual and spontaneous plants exhibited a linear decrease with increasing UDI, which explained 95% and 49% variation in PD for annual and spontaneous plants, respectively. The net relatedness index (NRI) for woody, perennial, and cultivated plants, as well as the net nearest taxon index (NTI) for perennial and cultivated plants, linearly increases with UDI, whereas the NRI for total, annual, and spontaneous plants, as well as NTI for total, woody, annual, and spontaneous plants linearly decrease with UDI. However, some of these trends were only marginally significant. 

Conclusions: The spatial patterns of plant phylogenetic diversity varied along the rural-to-urban gradients, indicating that urban environmental filtering has an impact on plant phylogenetic diversity. Urbanization increased the phylogenetic richness of different plant taxa in Shanghai but resulted in more clustering and relatedness of species within plant assemblages. Phylogenetic metrics showed a linear increase with UDI, while the degree of urbanization led to a decrease in phylogenetic divergence. The UDI is a useful predictor for examining variations in plant phylogeny due to urbanization. Our findings provide insights into how urbanization impacts plant phylogenetic diversity, helping urban plant diversity conservation.
