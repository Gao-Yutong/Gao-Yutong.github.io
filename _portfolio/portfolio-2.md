  * Participated in the plant species survey in Shanghai in 2023 as a re-survey in 2014. A total of 260 sample plots were randomly selected using 3 km × 3 km grids.


  * Identified plant species, recorded photographs, and surveyed all vascular plant species and quantities. Besides we collected surface soil samples to test its physical and chemical properties as well as pollutants. 


  * **(In addition to the plant survey and soil collection work, I was responsible for volunteer recruitment, organization, and training in my work.)**
