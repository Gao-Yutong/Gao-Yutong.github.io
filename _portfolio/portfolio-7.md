 *	Chose two villages in Mentougou District in Beijing as the research objects, collected the environmental data and thermal comfort information of the villages through field surveys 
 *	Utilized the Envi-met software to operate a numerical simulation of the microclimate environment and assess the thermal comfort level in the villages, researched the coupling relation such as wind, heat, and other microclimate elements and the internal spatial layout of traditional settlements
 *	Investigated the basic spatial patterns of the villages, explored the microclimatic characteristics of each spatial pattern type in the villages, 
 *	Surveyed the distribution pattern of thermal comfort in the villages, and probed into the relationship between thermal comfort and the spatial pattern of the villages, proposed strategies and suggestions to improve the village microclimate landscape
 *	Wrote a final report about the project, and received a top 20% merit rating from the China Agricultural University for the project results.
